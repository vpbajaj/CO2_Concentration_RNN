# CO2_Concentration_RNN
Hello World,
I was able to obtain the CO2 Concentration data from the Climate Data Guide. The data was collected by the Mauna Loa Observatory every month from March, 1958 to August, 2019. 
I was recently learned how to model time series data in the course Sequence, Time series and Predictions on Coursera. I modified the hyperparameters and parameters in the code that was used to model sunspots, and made a few additions to model the CO2 Concentration dataset. 
This is my first try modelling time series data using Neural Networks. I managed to get a mean absolute error of 2.
Appreciate your comments.
Thank you for reading.
